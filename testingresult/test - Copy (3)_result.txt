Python practice test 1. uses the flask framework to develop a RESTfulAPI that requires the API to meet the following requirements. 1) can read all files under any user specified folder, and at least support the wordtxt document. 2) after reading the file under the specified path, the content of the file is translated in English, and the translation of the third party's RESTAPI can be invoked in the Middle English translation. In this paper, the requirements to filter out the blank line, the entire space, void spaces. 3) write the translated content into the original file name _result file. 4) the final results after the translation (which files are translated successfully, which failed) are written to the summary.txt file under the specified folder in the 1). 5) the use of multithreading to translate the various files. The translation of each file is an independent thread. The system can handle up to 10 processes at the same time. Batch processing is performed when the number of files in the folder is more than 10. 6) request the return value of RESTAPI is included in the processing results (API received the document translation request, which does not support the translation (file format is not compatible with the contents of the file is empty, 7))) require the RESTAPI to support cross domain requests, and no built-in flask function method.
